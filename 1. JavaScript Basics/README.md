# JavaScript Basics

## 1. Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a dynamic, high-level programming language widely used for web development. It enables interactive web pages, runs in browsers, and supports both front-end and back-end development.

### Key Features:

- **Versatility:** Used for both client-side and server-side scripting.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Allows concurrent tasks without blocking.
- **Object-Oriented:** Prototype-based, facilitating code organization.

### Why Learn JavaScript?

- **Enhancing Interactivity:** Creates dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Full-stack Development:** Works on both front-end and back-end.
- **Thriving Ecosystem:** Abundance of libraries and frameworks.


## 2. Variables and Data Types

Mastering variables and data types is a foundational skill in JavaScript. This section delves into the intricacies of declaring variables and comprehending different data types.

### 2.1 Declaring Variables

In JavaScript, variables serve as containers for storing and manipulating data. They are declared using keywords like `let`, `const`, or `var`.

**Example:**
```javascript
let playerName = "John";
const age = 25;
var isAdmin = false;
```

- **let**: Allows reassignment of values.
- **const**: Immutable; its value cannot be changed once assigned.
- **var**: Similar to let but has broader scope rules (avoid using it in modern JavaScript).

### 2.2 Data Types
JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning variables can hold different data types during runtime. The primary data types include:

#### String:
Represents textual data, enclosed in single or double quotes.
**Example**
```javascript
let greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

#### Number:
Represents numeric data, including integers and decimals.
**Example**
```javascript
let weight = 17.5;
```

#### Boolean:
Represents logical data with values `true` or `false`.
**Example**
```javascript
let isActive = true;
```
